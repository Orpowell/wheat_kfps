# Analysis of Kinase Fusion Proteins

This repository is a collection of source code that supported the analyses of the KFPs in hexaploid wheat.

The code in this repository is to support reproducibility. It is not designed as stand-alone applications.

The HMM-Annotator and Tea-tools which are also described in this paper can be found [here]() and [here]().
